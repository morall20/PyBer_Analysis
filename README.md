## Overview of the analysis: 
V.Isualize has requested that I create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results: 
I develop a dataframe summary table and a multilined plot chart based on city types. The summary table establishes the overall totals for rides, drivers, and fares taken throughout the year for each city type. The chart also reflects the average fare for the drivers and average per ride for each city type.

From a quick analysis of the summary table, we can conclude that the Urban area of the city generated a high revenue stream then the other city types with a total of $39,854.38, with the suburban area coming in second with a revenue stream of $19,356.33 and the rural area coming in last with a revenue stream of $4,327.93. If we then look at the total rides against average fares, we can conclude that the rural and suburban areas had riders that took longer trips then the urban counterparts as the average fare per ride and driver were higher than the those in the Urban areas.

The multilined chart gives the client a visual representation of the 3 city area types (Urban, Suburban, Rural) fare pregression or degression between the time period of 01-01-2019 to 04-29-2019.

As the previous summary table suggest you can see that the Urban area collected higher monthly fare totals than the Suburban and Rural city areas. The Urban area also showed more consistent signs of growth in fare revenue throughout the time period which is clearly represented by the number of rides they had throughout it. All areas showed strong growth between the months of February and March with a subtle degression following afterwards then in the month of April the rural area again resurge with its strongest month.
 
## Summary: 
Based off our preliminary data sets I recommend:
1.	Do detail analysis into the disparities between in the number of drivers compared to the number rides in each city area. Overhead cost can be cut if driverâ€™s dispersal is leveled out more between the areas.
2.	Increase advertisement in the rural and suburban areas and fare rates in suburban and rural areas.
3.	Start new revenue streams by creating new share programs like Share-A-Ride.
